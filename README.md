# InstaFilter: Unleash Your Creativity with Photos

## Introduction

InstaFilter is a photo editing app developed with SwiftUI, allowing users to apply various filters to their photos. Created as part of my ongoing efforts to master SwiftUI and delve into image processing, this project combines SwiftUI's modern UI capabilities with Core Image's powerful processing functions to offer a seamless and intuitive photo editing experience.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** InstaFilter enables users to select photos from their library, apply multiple Core Image filters, and adjust filter parameters dynamically. Users can preview the effects in real-time and share their edited photos.
- **Technologies Used:** The app leverages SwiftUI and PhotosUI for its user interface and uses Core Image for photo processing. It also uses StoreKit to request review from the user. This project showcases handling of image data, dynamic filter adjustments, and saving images.
- **App Demo:**

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The main goal behind InstaFilter was to understand how to integrate Core Image with SwiftUI for real-time photo editing, including the dynamic application of filters.
- **Challenge:** Implementing an interface for users to dynamically adjust filter parameters required a deep dive into Core Image's capabilities. I developed a flexible UI that adapts to selected filters and their specific adjustable parameters, ensuring a user-friendly editing process.
- **Skills Gained:** Through InstaFilter, I've significantly improved my understanding of image processing in iOS. The project also enhanced my skills in designing intuitive user interfaces for complex functionalities.
